# Pet-Shelter-API

This is code for a pet shelter API, which uses Google Cloud Datastore to store pets and shelters. Using various routes, users can use CRUD operations in order to interact with the pets and shelters entities within the Datastore.

The Postman tests found in the postman folder demonstrate various CRUD operations.

Users can also create an account in order to interact with the entities using this link: <https://pet-adoption-api.wl.r.appspot.com/>
